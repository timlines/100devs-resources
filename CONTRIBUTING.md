TO DO:

Add contribution guidelines. These could include:

- Steps for creating good issues or pull requests.
- Links to external documentation, mailing lists, or a code of conduct.
- Community and behavioral expectations.

### Guidelines

Use APA style when adding references. See [apa.org](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references/examples) for some examples.

If additional work needs to be added create an unordered list below each reference. (for example, a link to a repo of various books, could be broken up to be a unique reference for each book.)

use has:link in:resources in the 100devs resources channel to filter links.
