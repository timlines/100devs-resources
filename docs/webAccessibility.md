Hi everyone! I wanted to share some info and resources on Web Accessibility since it is very important.

What is Accessibility and Why Should I Care?
Accessibility is making sure your website is usable by as many groups of people as possible. Think of it like having a store that only has stairs. There are some people who won't be able to shop at your store because they can't use stairs - and that's a shame cuz you would be missing out on potential customers.

The same thing applies to Web Accessibility. You want a website that is able to be used by as many people as possible. Some examples include:

- people who use screen readers or keyboards to navigate websites

- people who wear glasses may have trouble navigating sites with tiny fonts

- if your website is too complex it may be too hard to load on slower internet connections

- if you use colors without enough contrast many people with colorblindness will be unable to see elements on your pages

So it's important to realize that accessibility is for EVERYONE, and there are some simple things you can do to ensure your website is accessible.

Here are some resources to check out and start practicing now. I encourage you to practice web accessibility in all of your projects as you work through the course. It will not only make you a better programmer but produce better websites that more people are able to use.
