If you are sharing code on Discord, you can use ` and ```, instead of posting pictures. This makes it easier to help, as other can copy and paste the code into their own text editor to figure out where the problem is.

If you want the code to be inline with the rest of the text, wrap the code with a single backtick, `. For example, `.split()` becomes .split().

If you are sharing a block of code, wrap the code with three backticks, ```. For example:

```
function sum(x, y) {
    return x + y
}
```

function sum(x, y) {
return x + y
}

To enable syntax highlighting, like you have in your text editor, specify the language after the first ```. For example:

```javascript
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
```

function sum(x, y) {
return x + y
}

(If there is a better place for this, let me know.)
