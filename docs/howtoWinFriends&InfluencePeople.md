How to Win Friends & Influence People

Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

1. Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.
   ● When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic.
   We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and
   motivated by pride and vanity.
2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.
   ● If you tell me how you get your feelings of importance, I’ll tell you what you are. That
   determines your character.
   ● Dr. Dewey said the deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.
3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.
   ● The only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show
   them how to get it.
   ● Henry Ford said if there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other
   person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.

4. Become genuinely interested in other people.
   ● People are not interested in you. They are not interested in me. They are interested in
   themselves.
   ● Alfred Adler said it is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the
   greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among
   such individuals that all human failures spring.
5. Smile
   ● The expression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes one wears
   on one’s back.
   ● You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time
   meeting you.
6. Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in
   any language.
   ● Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective
   complement.
   ● We should be aware of the magic contained in a name and realize that this single item is
   wholly and completely owned by the person with whom we are dealing- and nobody else.
7. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
   ● Listen intently. Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very
   important.
   ● Be an attentive listener. To be interesting, be interested. Ask questions that the other
   person will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their
   accomplishments.
8. Talk in terms of the other person’s interests.
   ● The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.

    by humbly admitting that he/she is far from impeccable.
