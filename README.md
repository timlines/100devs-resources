- I figured this might be useful since heroku alternatives are asked for so often:
  There's plenty of alternatives, 100Devs likes https://cyclic.sh/, as they hired one of us!
  Alternatives are:
  https://render.com/
  https://fly.io/
  https://railway.app/
  https://deta.space/
  https://vercel.com/

- Special mentions:
  https://planetscale.com/ a managed database with a generous free tier
  https://turso.tech/ a managed sqllite db, that supports 500 databases at the free tier
  https://www.netlify.com/ great for static pages, has some serverless support, includes nice contact form support
  https://pages.github.com/ the easiest static site to get up

- For larger projects:
  https://firebase.google.com/ generous free tier, managed BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service)
  https://pages.cloudflare.com/ generous static site support, ability to grow into the rest of the cloudflare family, like https://workers.cloudflare.com/ for serverless support
