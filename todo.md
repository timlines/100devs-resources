# TODO:

- Remove duplicates
- Sort and categorize
- Add a fuzzy finder like fuse [https://www.fusejs.io/](https://www.fusejs.io/)
- In the resource channel, many users are asking questions to find resources. Figure out what's the best way to search for resources.
- How should this handle large websites of lots of good info like MDN? Should some sub topics be included for example arrow_functions? or should it just list the home page of the site? or some combination of both?
- figure out how to add the most recent comments to the log and update.
